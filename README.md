# 🏥 Medical Insurance Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses **machine learning** to predict the **medical insurance premium** of an individual based on their personal and lifestyle features like age, BMI, smoking habits, number of children, region, and gender. The model is trained using the **Random Forest Regressor** and deployed as an **interactive web application** using **Streamlit**.
